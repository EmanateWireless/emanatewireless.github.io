<h2 style="color:black;">Emanate Wireless Awarded Competitive Grant from the National Science Foundation - <em>Small Business Innovation Research Program Provides Seed Funding for R&D</em> </h2>

        <p>CLEVELAND, OHIO — September 15, 2020  — Emanate Wireless has been awarded a National Science Foundation (NSF) Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant for $255K to conduct research and development work on a unique healthcare IOT solution: Utilization, Condition, and Location System (UCLS). UCLS uses smart tags with sensors and machine learning algorithms to track the utilization, condition and location of medical equipment within a healthcare facility. The NSF funding will support pilot trials with three major hospital groups.<br>
</p>
        <p>Managing medical devices is one of the top cost centers for a hospital. UCLS provides actionable insights to healthcare administrators to help them discover under-utilized equipment, optimize equipment workflows and implement usage and condition-based maintenance schedules. Current hospital asset tracking solutions (known as RTLS) attempt to track the location of assets, but do not provide context on what the device is doing or how effectively it is operating. The addition of measured utilization and condition data enhances patient safety and enables cost savings related to purchased equipment and maintenance.  <br>
  </p>
        <p>“NSF is proud to support the technology of the future by thinking beyond incremental developments and funding the most creative, impactful ideas across all markets and areas of science and engineering,” said Andrea Belz, Division Director of the Division of Industrial Innovation and Partnerships at NSF. “With the support of our research funds, any deep technology startup or small business can guide basic science into meaningful solutions that address tremendous needs.” <br>
          </p>
        <p>"Emanate is very excited to be a recipient of NSF funding to help advance our critical healthcare IoT solution,” said Emanate Wireless CEO Neil Diener. “In the Industrial IoT space, it's common to use sensors to track the usage and condition of critical devices, but healthcare is lagging on this technology. Our solutions will help healthcare institutions save on equipment costs which can be re-applied to enhancing patient outcomes and experience." <br>
          </p>
        <p>Once a small business is awarded a Phase I SBIR/STTR grant (up to $256,000), it becomes eligible to apply for a Phase II grant (up to $1,000,000). Small businesses with Phase II grants are eligible to receive up to $500,000 in additional matching funds with qualifying third-party investment or sales. </p>
        <p>Once Emanate’s system detects an event that defies expected patterns or thresholds, alarms can issue to appropriate staff. In February, the new “Enterprise Tier” subscription will provide integrated text- and email-based alarm notifications. This tier will also go beyond the “Basic Tier” subscription with compliance reports and resolution logging.</p>
        <p>Startups or entrepreneurs who submit a<a href="https://seedfund.nsf.gov/apply/" target="_blank"> three-page Project Pitch</a> will know within three weeks if they meet the program’s objectives to support innovative technologies that show promise of commercial and/or societal impact and involve a level of technical risk. Small businesses with innovative science and technology solutions, and commercial potential are encouraged to apply. All proposals submitted to the NSF SBIR/STTR program, also known as America’s Seed Fund powered by NSF, undergo a rigorous merit-based review process.

              <div class="modal-body grey">

                <p>CLEVELAND, OHIO — February 1, 2015 — Emanate Wireless Chief Executive Officer Neil Diener announced today the launch of the company's flagship product, PowerPath™, a real-time location device for the healthcare industry.</p>

                <p>"PowerPath is the industry's most advanced Smart Tag for real-time location solutions," Diener explained, "because it pro-vides usage context for assets, includes a rechargeable, lifetime battery and works with our smartphone app to enhance location accuracy for users — leading hospital and other healthcare staffers directly to virtually any medical equipment to which it's attached."</p>

                <p>In addition, PowerPath lets hospital administrators track utilization of equipment and avoid costly purchases by helping them optimize the use of equipment a hospital already owns. PowerPath plugs into medical equipment and then plugs into AC wall power, ensuring the rechargeable battery never fails.</p>
                
                <p>"It's quick to deploy, field manageable, and once mounted, lasts the life of the asset," Diener added.</p>

                <p>CLEVELAND, OHIO — Janaury 2, 2014 — Imagine a world where the things you're seeking find you.</p>

                <p>That's precisely how Neil Diener, CEO of the newly-minted Emanate Wireless described the company he has co-founded with a group of executives with wireless technology experience.</p>

                <p>"We formed Emanate Wireless to help the healthcare industry take advantage of what many people refer to as 'the Internet of Things,'" Diener explained.</p>

                <p>"We're imagining smart, Internet-enabled devices throughout healthcare campuses being able to interact with each other in new and brighter ways," he continued. "Our first effort will be a real-time location tag — hardware that attaches to medical devices to provide detailed utilization and location data via a smartphone app and cloud services. The hardware will include features like a lifetime battery, among others — features nobody seems to have imagined before."</p>

                <p>The company has the chops to get it done. Joining Diener (a former wireless company founder and recent Cisco executive) are co-founders Gary Sugar, an RFID expert with a background in wireless technology; Chandra Vaidyanathan, a founder of two, previous, successful high-tech startups and a former manager of Cisco research and development team; and Yohannes Tesfai, a former lead architect for signal classification technology at Cognio.</p>

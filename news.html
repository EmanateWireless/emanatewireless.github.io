        <h2 class="heading-2-color-black">Emanate Launches World’s First Battery-Powered BLE Doorway Chokepoint, with 99.9% Room-Level Accuracy </h2>
		  
		  <span class="h3">RadioVision™ Platform Brings Disruptive Cost and Deployment Advantages to Hospitals Worldwide</span><br><br>

        <p>CLEVELAND, OHIO — June 27, 2025 — Emanate Wireless today announced the official launch of its groundbreaking <strong>RadioVision™ BLE Doorway Chokepoint</strong>, the <strong>first-ever battery-powered BLE device</strong> to enable <strong>clinical-grade room-accurate (99.9%) BLE RTLS solutions</strong> for hospitals and healthcare providers. Built on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 5.1 Angle of Arrival (AoA) technology and machine learning, RadioVision™ is designed to democratize RTLS by eliminating the cost and complexity barriers that have stalled adoption across the healthcare industry.<br>
        </p>
        <p>Traditional room-accurate RTLS solutions require expensive wired infrastructure, proprietary tags, and complex installation—costing upwards of $1,500 per room. RadioVision™ changes the game. With <strong>low-cost, battery-operated sensors</strong> that mount easily in doorways and <strong>support for off-the-shelf BLE tags and devices</strong>, the system can be deployed in a fraction of the time and cost. <br>
        </p>
        <p>“RadioVision™ enables BLE-based RTLS platforms to deliver <strong>hospital-grade accuracy without the hospital-grade price tag</strong>”, said <strong>Neil Diener</strong>, CEO and co-founder of Emanate Wireless. “We saw an opportunity to eliminate the barriers that kept 75% of hospitals from adopting RTLS. With RadioVision™, you can deploy in days, track with near-perfect room-accuracy, and do it all using tags you already own.” <br>
        </p>
        <p>RadioVision™ sensors use BLE angle-of-arrival signals and trained machine learning algorithms to determine if a staff member, patient, or piece of equipment enters or exits a room—ensuring accurate, reliable data without wiring, calibration, or false room events. RadioVision™ integrates seamlessly with any BLE RTLS system, allowing BLE-based RTLS OEM partners to build room-accurate applications for workflow automation, safety alerts, asset tracking, and more. <br>
        </p>
        <p>“Legacy RTLS systems are just too expensive and too complicated. We built RadioVision™ to fix that,” said <strong>Gary Sugar, CTO and VP of Engineering</strong> at Emanate Wireless. “With battery power, no cabling, and compatibility with everyday BLE devices like phones or smartwatches, we’re enabling <strong>room-level intelligence at 10% of the traditional cost.</strong>” </p>
		  
		  
        <p><strong>Key use cases</strong> include nurse call-cancel, patient–staff interaction, staff duress safety, PAR-level asset management, hand hygiene compliance—making RadioVision™ more than a tracker: it’s an enabler for clinical and operational intelligence.</p>
		  
		  
        <p><strong>Emanate’s business model</strong> focuses on OEM partnerships, licensing its hardware-software solution to RTLS vendors and other solution providers. The company has already secured its <strong>first commercial partner</strong> and is <strong>actively engaged with additional OEMs in advanced evaluations</strong>. RadioVision™ has been successfully deployed in hospital pilot environments, demonstrating <strong>room-level accuracy with sub-6 second latency</strong>. The company was also awarded an <strong>NSF SBIR grant</strong> in recognition of its innovation in BLE-based RTLS.</p>

              <p>CLEVELAND, OHIO — February 1, 2015 — Emanate Wireless Chief Executive Officer Neil Diener announced
                today the launch of the company's flagship product, PowerPath™, a real-time location device for the
                healthcare industry.</p>

              <p>"PowerPath is the industry's most advanced Smart Tag for real-time location solutions," Diener
                explained, "because it pro-vides usage context for assets, includes a rechargeable, lifetime battery and
                works with our smartphone app to enhance location accuracy for users — leading hospital and other
                healthcare staffers directly to virtually any medical equipment to which it's attached."</p>

              <p>In addition, PowerPath lets hospital administrators track utilization of equipment and avoid costly
                purchases by helping them optimize the use of equipment a hospital already owns. PowerPath plugs into
                medical equipment and then plugs into AC wall power, ensuring the rechargeable battery never fails.</p>

              <p>"It's quick to deploy, field manageable, and once mounted, lasts the life of the asset," Diener added.
              </p>

              <p>CLEVELAND, OHIO — Janaury 2, 2014 — Imagine a world where the things you're seeking find you.</p>

              <p>That's precisely how Neil Diener, CEO of the newly-minted Emanate Wireless described the company he has
                co-founded with a group of executives with wireless technology experience.</p>

              <p>"We formed Emanate Wireless to help the healthcare industry take advantage of what many people refer to
                as 'the Internet of Things,'" Diener explained.</p>

              <p>"We're imagining smart, Internet-enabled devices throughout healthcare campuses being able to interact
                with each other in new and brighter ways," he continued. "Our first effort will be a real-time location
                tag — hardware that attaches to medical devices to provide detailed utilization and location data via a
                smartphone app and cloud services. The hardware will include features like a lifetime battery, among
                others — features nobody seems to have imagined before."</p>

              <p>The company has the chops to get it done. Joining Diener (a former wireless company founder and recent
                Cisco executive) are co-founders Gary Sugar, an RFID expert with a background in wireless technology;
                Chandra Vaidyanathan, a founder of two, previous, successful high-tech startups and a former manager of
                Cisco research and development team; and Yohannes Tesfai, a former lead architect for signal
                classification technology at Cognio.</p>
